# Academic Response Letter Template

This repository provides a LaTeX template for writing response letters to reviewers and editors when submitting academic papers to journals or conferences (such as IEEE TSE, TOSEM, ICSE, etc.). The template demonstrates a clear, polite, and structured approach to replying to review comments, making it easier for authors—especially non-native English speakers—to prepare professional response documents.

## Features

* **Clear structure:** Separates responses to the editor and each reviewer into individual files for modular editing.
* **Common expressions:** Includes templates for polite and effective responses to typical reviewer concerns.
* **Custom commands:** Supports easy formatting of comments and replies (italic/reviewers, normal/authors, highlighted changes, etc.).
* **Easy customization:** Use of placeholders (e.g., `[Paper Title]`, `[Date]`, `[Section X]`) for quick adaptation to your own submissions.

## How to Use

1. **Clone or download** this repository.
2. Replace placeholder text (`[Paper Title]`, `[Journal Name]`, etc.) with your actual information.
3. Write your point-by-point responses in the respective files (`reviewer1.tex`, etc.).
4. Compile `main.tex` with LaTeX to generate your response letter PDF.

> **Tip:** The template is modular. You can add more reviewer files or remove unused ones as needed.

## Command Introduction

The template provides the following custom LaTeX commands and environments in `commands.sty` to help you quickly create a clear and organized response letter:

| Command / Environment      | Description                                           | Example Usage                                       |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `\revisionblock{...}`      | Highlights a block of revised text.                   | `\revisionblock{This part is revised.}`             |
| `\question{...}`           | Marks or highlights a reviewer’s question.            | `\question{Is this clear?}`                         |
| `\doubleCheck{...}`        | Marks a section for further double checking.          | `\doubleCheck{Check this again.}`                   |
| `generalcomment` (env)     | Formats reviewer’s main/general comment (italic).     | `\begin{generalcomment}...\end{generalcomment}`     |
| `generalresponse` (env)    | Formats your main/general response (normal font).     | `\begin{generalresponse}...\end{generalresponse}`   |
| `reviewercomment` (env)    | Formats a specific reviewer comment.                  | `\begin{reviewercomment}...\end{reviewercomment}`   |
| `reviewerresponse` (env)   | Formats your response to a specific reviewer comment. | `\begin{reviewerresponse}...\end{reviewerresponse}` |

**Use these commands and environments to clearly organize your cover page, reviewer comments, responses, and revised content, making your letter both professional and easy to read.**

## Customization

* The provided `commands.sty` and `ar2rc.cls` files allow for further customization of formatting or macros.
* You can easily modify section headers or add new environments if your target journal/conference has specific requirements.
