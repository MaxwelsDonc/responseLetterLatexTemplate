    Dear \printeditorname,
  \end{flushleft}

  \vspace{0.8em}

  Thank you for your email of \printdecisiondate, regarding our manuscript entitled “\textit{\printpapertitle},” originally submitted to the \textit{\printjournalname}.
  We have carefully revised the manuscript in response to the comments provided by the Associate Editor and the three reviewers. 
  Based on your suggestion, we are now submitting the revised manuscript as a \textit{new submission}. 
  For your reference, the original log number is \printmanusid.

  For clarity and ease of reading, the following formatting conventions are used throughout this response:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Reviewers’ comments are presented in \textit{italic font} to distinguish them from the responses.

    \item The responses appear in regular font.

    \item Revised sentences in the manuscript with tracked changes are highlighted in {\color{blue} blue} to clearly indicate the changes made.

    \item When revised text is quoted in this response letter, it is shown in {\color{blue} blue} for consistency.

    \item Minor issues raised by the reviewers are also numbered and addressed individually.
  \end{itemize}

  We look forward to hearing from you and sincerely appreciate your time and consideration.

  Please ensure that all figures are of high quality (at least 300 dpi) and that the references follow the journal's style guide.
\end{generalcomment}
\begin{generalresponse}
  We have double-checked all figures and replaced low-resolution images with vector graphics or high-resolution bitmaps where appropriate. We have also verified the reference formatting to ensure compliance with the journal's guidelines.

\begin{generalcomment}
  \label{com1.0}
  The paper presents an interesting approach to optimizing neural networks for edge devices. However, the experimental validation needs to be strengthened, particularly regarding the comparison with state-of-the-art methods.
\end{generalcomment}
\begin{generalresponse}
  Thank you for your positive feedback and constructive suggestions. We have significantly expanded the experimental section by including comparisons with three additional state-of-the-art methods~\cite{EtAlForever2020}.
\end{generalresponse}
\end{generalblock}

%============================= Comment 1.1 ======================================
\begin{reviewerblock}
\begin{reviewercomment}
  \label{com1.1}
  It is unclear how the proposed method handles varying network architectures. Could the authors provide more details on the generalization capability of their approach?
\end{reviewercomment}

\begin{reviewerresponse}
  We appreciate this insightful comment. Our method is designed to be architecture-agnostic.

  \label{com1.2}
  Figure 3 is difficult to read. The font size of the axis labels is too small.
\end{reviewercomment}

\begin{reviewerresponse}
  We apologize for the oversight. We have redrawn Figure 3 with larger font sizes for the axis labels and legends to improve readability.

\begin{generalblock}
\begin{generalcomment}
\label{com2.0}
This paper addresses a timely problem. The proposed method is technically sound, but the introduction could be improved to better motivate the research.
\end{generalcomment}

\begin{generalresponse}
Thank you for your encouraging comments. We have rewritten the Introduction to better highlight the challenges in deploying large neural networks on resource-constrained edge devices and to clearly state our contributions.
\end{generalresponse}
\end{generalblock}

%============================= Comment 2.1 =====================================
\begin{reviewerblock}
\begin{reviewercomment}
\label{com2.1}
In Equation (5), the variable $\lambda$ is introduced but not defined.
\end{reviewercomment}

\begin{reviewerresponse}
Thank you for pointing this out. We have added the definition of $\lambda$ immediately after Equation (5). It represents the regularization coefficient.

\end{reviewerresponse}
\end{reviewerblock}
%============================= Comment 2.2 =====================================
\begin{reviewerblock}
\begin{reviewercomment}
\label{com2.2}
The ablation study in Table 2 is informative, but it would be better to include the inference time as a metric.
\end{reviewercomment}

\begin{reviewerresponse}
We agree with the reviewer. We have updated Table 2 to include the average inference time (in milliseconds) measured on a Raspberry Pi 4 device. The results show that our method achieves a 20\% reduction in latency compared to the baseline.

Page 4, line 15: "network are" should be "network is".

Fixed. Thank you for catching this typo.

Please check the formatting of Reference~\cite{EtAlForever2020}.
\end{reviewercomment}

\begin{reviewerresponse}
We have corrected the formatting of Reference~\cite{EtAlForever2020} to ensure it matches the journal's citation style.
