\begin{generalcomment}
This paper addresses an important problem and proposes a new method. However, I have concerns regarding the experimental setup and clarity of some explanations~\cite{smith2023}.

\begin{generalresponse}
We thank the reviewer for the thorough review and constructive suggestions. In response, we have:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Improved the explanation of our proposed method (see Section~X).
    \item Revised the experimental setup to enhance clarity and reproducibility (see Section~Y).
    \item Clarified our results and added further discussion to address your concerns (see Section~Z).
\end{itemize}
We hope these revisions address your concerns.
